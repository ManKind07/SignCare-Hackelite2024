# üß† Static Sign Language Detection with MediaPipe and Virtual Webcam

This project captures **static (non-moving) sign language gestures** from a webcam, classifies them in real-time, and streams the annotated video feed to a **virtual webcam** for use in applications like **Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams**.

It uses **Google's MediaPipe** for high-fidelity hand and landmark tracking, and a **Random Forest classifier** for a lightweight and fast machine learning model.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Classification:** Detects and classifies 10 different static signs in real-time.  
- **Two-Hand Support:** Recognizes signs requiring one or two hands via landmark padding.  
- **Virtual Webcam Output:** Uses `pyvirtualcam` to create a new ‚Äúwebcam‚Äù device for video conferencing apps.  
- **Lightweight Model:** Employs `scikit-learn`‚Äôs Random Forest ‚Äî fast, CPU-only.  
- **Customizable:** Collect and train on your own set of static gestures.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works ‚Äî The 4-Script Pipeline

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `collect_imgs.py` ‚Äî Data Collection  
- Uses **OpenCV** to access your webcam.  
- Loops through each class (10 by default, from `'0'` to `'9'`).  
- For each class:
  - Prompts you to press `Q` to begin.  
  - Rapidly saves **500 images** to `data/0`, `data/1`, etc.  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `create_datasets.py` ‚Äî Feature Extraction  
- Loads all captured images.  
- Uses **MediaPipe** to detect hand landmarks.  
- Normalizes and pads data (84 features total).  
- Saves all landmark vectors + labels into `data.pickle`.  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `train_classifier.py` ‚Äî Model Training  
- Loads `data.pickle`.  
- Splits data: **80% training, 20% testing**.  
- Trains a `RandomForestClassifier`.  
- Evaluates accuracy on unseen data.  
- Saves trained model as `model.p`.  

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ `Main.py` ‚Äî Real-Time Application  
- Loads your trained `model.p`.  
- Runs MediaPipe live on webcam feed.  
- Predicts a sign for each frame.  
- Draws hand skeleton + label (e.g., *‚ÄúThank You‚Äù*).  
- Streams annotated feed to a **virtual webcam**.
